    Acupuncture is extremely safe. It is an all-natural, drug-free therapy. Acupuncture has virtually no negative side
    effects. It does however produce feelings of relaxation and well-being. There is little danger of infection from the
    acupuncture needles because State law requires that all practitioners to use sterilized one-time-use needles. Always
    seek a licensed acupuncturist for your acupuncture treatment.
